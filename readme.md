# Barri

**A Moderation Bot written in Typescript using the Oceanic Library.**

**You can find the official instance [here!](https://shorturl.at/rxRY3)**

## Features

- Basic Moderation (kick, ban, timeout, etc.)
- Robust Antispam (with message info and database caching for faster operations)
- Customizable Settings (warn and antispam system)
- Warn System (with Auto-Punishing)
- Bot Admin Commands (eval, system stats, kill process)

**Since I am now running my own instance, specific instructions for bot setup have been removed. I will still accept issues and questions about the bot and provide support.**
